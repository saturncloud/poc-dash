# Using Dash in Saturn Cloud

This example shows how to use Dash in Saturn Cloud. It consists of a Jupyter Server to edit the code and a deployment to run the dashboard. Both are connected to this git repository.

The example shows a UMAP projection of the MNIST fashion and digits datasets.

To manipulate the dashboard, edit the code in a Jupyter notebook and refresh the deployment.
